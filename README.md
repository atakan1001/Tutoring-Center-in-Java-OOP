# Tutoring Center in Java OOP
 The project is a tutoring center system with various user roles such as students, tutors, and an administrator. Each type of user can login with their username and password, and new users can sign up to the system. The system allows students to view their balance, register for courses, drop courses, and view their course history. Tutors can view their courses taught, drop courses, teach courses, and view their schedules. The administrator can add new courses, view the income of each tutor, inquire about a student's information, and view the list of students registered in a particular course as well as the schedules of tutors teaching that course. The system uses various OOP concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and abstract classes. The GUI components are designed using JPanel as a container and Absolute Layout as a layout manager. Overall, the system is functional, efficient, and follows good coding practices.
